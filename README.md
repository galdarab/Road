This is a simple browser-based game where a character (Olive) moves across a road, reacting to user inputs to change direction. It uses HTML5 <canvas> to render the animations and user interactions.

Features:
Character Movement: Use arrow keys to control the direction of the olive character.
Left Arrow (←): Move Left
Right Arrow (→): Move Right
Up Arrow (↑): Move Up
Down Arrow (↓): Move Down
Road Scrolling: The road background scrolls continuously to create a moving effect.
Zoom Effect: The olive character can zoom in or out depending on the vertical movement.
How It Works:
The game loads a road background and an olive sprite that moves across the canvas.
The sprite changes position based on user input (arrow keys).
A zoom effect is applied when the olive moves up or down.
The road background moves horizontally in response to user input.
